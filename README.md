# Pygame Manager
This is an interface that allows the user to easily interface with pygame.

## Screenshots
![Space Shooter](Images/pb-demo.PNG?raw=true)

## Usage
```python
from pygame_manager import PygameManager, PygameColors, PygameKeys

pm = PygameManager()

# Add your code here

pm.start_game()
```

## Help
All of the models, classes, and methods have documentation notes attached. You can access class attributes if necessary, but most of the functionality is done through PygameManager. Look at main.py and space_shooter.py for an example. Run them by typing this in the terminal.
```bash
py main.py

py space_shooter.py
```
